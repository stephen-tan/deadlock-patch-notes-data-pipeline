Players can temporarily lose access to certain capabilities in the game. The controls include Matchmaking, Voice Chat, Text Chat, Pausing, and Reporting. The system for tracking is active now, however we will wait on most penalties for a few days as we review the results.\n\n- There is now a low priority queue. The primary way to enter this is through abandoning games, but it can include other behavior. You must complete the required amount of games (escalates based on low priority frequency) to be able to return to using matchmaking normally.\n\n- Regularly misreporting players will result in you losing the reporting function and may in some cases cause you to go into low priority as well.\n\n\n\n- New players that are queued solo will only match with other new players until they get 4 wins\n\n- The lane allocation of 1-1-2-2- and 2-2-1-1 will no longer be a possible setup\n\n- A 6 player party will no longer match against solo players. This may result in longer queue times for 6 stacks.\n\n- AFK players will be automatically kicked out after a few minutes\n\n- Abandon Match dialog is now more clear about consequences of leaving\n\n- Abandon Match now has a time delay before you can click it to help protect against some accidental cases\n\n\n\n- Added custom hotkeys per hero\n\n\n\n- Bounce Pad visuals have been replaced with a wind fan (no mechanic changes).

In this update we have separated the behavior of these two modes to better serve different functions. The keys used for each of these modes can be swapped within Keybinds Settings.\u200b\n\u200b\nScoreboard (TAB):\u200b\n- Enables cursor mode\u200b\n- Displays Scoreboard\u200b\n- Displays Damage Summary\u200b\n- Allows minimap ping and draw\u200b\n\u200b\nExtra Info (ALT):\u200b\n- No longer enables cursor mode\u200b\n- Quick-upgrade Abilities (ie. ALT+1) each of these can be individually remapped\u200b\n- Can now more easily map ALT as an Alternate Cast button\u200b\n- Displays extra information on HUD (ie. Zipline Speed Boost Cooldown) - we plan to expand upon this in future updates\u200b\n\u200b\n\n- Client performance improvements\n\n- Game now automatically starts preloading the map once the client is launched, to help reduce load time for most users\n\n\n\n- Sand Box orb practice area now displays the time in milliseconds that you hit the orb after spawning\n\n\n\n- Added a console command (private_lobby_create) to allow players to create custom lobbies using our servers.

etc)\n\n- Adjusted Midboss low health roar sound to be more distinct from spawn sound\n\n- Added Maximum FPS Sliders for Dashboard and In-Game\n\n- Removed Pause limit for hero testing, coop bot matches, and the tutorial\n\n- Added support for launching the game in a secondary monitor properly\n\n- Fixed friends menu scrolling up automatically when it shouldn't\n\n- Fixed being unable to
